See the parent-level **README.md** for more details, but the flow of the implementation should follow this diagram:

## Instructions for running the CafeDemo JMS sample

### Distributed components
To run this configuration, start an instance of ActiveMQ with the openwire/TCP connector available on the default port (61616). There are no credentials of which to be aware. Please execute the following classes in order:

   1. **CafeDemoAppBaristaColdActiveMQ - starts the ColdDrink Barista
   2. **CafeDemoAppBaristaHotActiveMQ  - starts the HotDrink Barista
   3. **CafeDemoAppOperationsActiveMQ  - starts the Cafe Operations (order splitter, drink router, etc).
   4. **CafeDemoAppActiveMQ            - places the orders

### JMS backed components

See **CafeDemoActiveMQBackedChannels** for an example of how to use the JMS-backed channels. No need to start an external ActiveMQ because one is started internally
