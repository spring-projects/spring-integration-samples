= File Split and FTP Sample

- Looks for files `*.txt` in `/tmp/in`
- Reads file and writes to 3 files based on account (first 4 bytes in file)
- FileSplitter -> router [lines -> `lines`], [file marks -> `marks`]
- `marks` filters on EOF marker (drops SOF)
- pubsub [flush files], [ftp (x3)], [email result]
- Exceptions go to `tfrErrors` - sends failure email
- input file is renamed, based on final dispostion

Test cases are provided for happy path and failure scenarios

Run `ApplicationTests` as a JUnit test from your IDE.
