WebSockets Sample
==============

This example demonstrates the Standard WebSocket protocol (without any sub-protocols) with Spring Integration Adapters.
It just sends current time from the server to all connected clients.

## Server

The server is presented only with a single `org.springframework.integration.samples.websocket.standard.server.Application`
class, which is based on the Spring Boot AutoConfiguration and Spring Integration Java & Annotation configuration.
It is a `main` and starts an embedded Tomcat server on the default `8080` port. The WebSocket endpoint is mapped to the `/time` path.

The server also can be run from Gradle `gradlew :web-sockets:run`

## Java Client

The `org.springframework.integration.samples.websocket.standard.client.Application` is a simple Java application,
 which starts an integration flow (`client-context.xml`), connects to the WebSocket server and prints `Message`s to the 
 logs, which are received over WebSocket.
   
## Browser Client
   
The `index.html` in the `src/main/resources/static` directory of this project demonstrates a JavaScript `SockJS` client, which connects
to our server and just prints its messages in the middle of page. It can be reached at http://localhost:8080/index.html.
 
## Test Case

The `org.springframework.integration.samples.websocket.standard.ApplicationTests` demonstrates the Spring Boot test 
framework and starts Server & Client to check, that the client receives correct data.
