/**
 * This class is used to demonstrate how you can create a custom serializer/deserializer
 * to convert a TCP stream into custom objects which your domain-specific code can use.
 *
 * Since this is custom, it will have to have its own predefined assumptions for dealing
 * with the stream. In other words, there will have to be some indication within the
 * contents of the stream where the beginning/end is and how to extract the contents
 * into something meaningful (like an object). An example would be a fixed-file formatted
 * stream with the length encoded in some well known part of the stream (for example, the
 * first 8 bytes of the stream?).
 *
 * This custom serializer/deserializer assumes the first 3 bytes of the stream will be
 * considered an Order Number, the next 10 bytes will be the Sender's Name, the next 6 bytes
 * represents an left-zero-padded integer that specifies how long the rest of the message
 * content is. After that message content is parsed from the stream, the stream is assumed
 * to not have anything after it. In your code you could have delimiters to mark the end
 * of the stream, or could agree with the client that a valid stream is only n characters,
 * etc. Either way, since its custom, the client and server must have some predefined
 * assumptions in place for the communication to take place.
